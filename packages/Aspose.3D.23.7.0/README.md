[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) empowers .NET applications to connect with 3D document formats. 3D .NET API lets engineers read, convert, build, alter, and control the substance of the [3D document formats](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/net/supported-file-formats/) without any 3D modeling and rendering software installed on the machine.

## What is Aspose.3D for .NET?

[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) is an on premise class library that enables your .NET applications to create, read, manipulate, convert and save various formats of 3D files (e.g. 3DS, 3MF, DAE, DFX, gITF, U3D, MB, MA, USDZ etc.), without installing any 3rd party 3D modeling or rendering software.

[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) API enhances your .NET apps to open files of 3D formats and work with the elements within the 3D scenes; such as; line, mesh, nurbs, curves to more complex elements like animation. You can also work with textures, parametrized geometries, scene graphs, custom properties, skeletons, morph deformers and much more.

[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) can be used on any operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux) that can install Mono (.NET 4.0 Framework support) or use .NET Core. It is a single .NET library that you can deploy with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about other services or modules. Aspose.3D for .NET is designed to perform equally well on the server as well as the client-side.

## Platform Independence

[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) is written in C# and supports Windows Forms as well as ASP.NET apps. Development can be performed on any platform that has a .NET environment for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. It supports .NET Frameworks 2.0 till 4.7.2 as well as the Client Profile version for .NET Framework 4.0.

## Get Started
Are you ready to give [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) a try? Simply execute `Install-Package Aspose.3D` from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package. If you already have [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) and want to upgrade the version, please execute `Update-Package Aspose.3D` to get the latest version.

## Build a Scene with Primitive 3D Models using C# Code
You can execute the below code snippet to see how Aspose.3D performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.

```c#
// initialize a Scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
// create a Box model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
// create a Cylinder model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("cylinder", new Cylinder());
// save drawing in FBX format
scene.Save(dir + "output.fbx", FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

## Export 3D Scene to Compressed AMF via C# Code
[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/) enables you to save 3D meshes in custom binary format, get all property values of 3D scenes as well as flip their coordinate system. The following example demonstrates the conversion of a 3D scene to AMF format while applying compression to it.

```c#
// load a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
var box = new Box();
var tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
tr.Scale = new Vector3(12, 12, 12);
tr.Translation = new Vector3(10, 0, 0);
tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
// scale transform
tr.Scale = new Vector3(5, 5, 5);
// set Euler angles
tr.EulerAngles = new Vector3(50, 10, 0);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode();
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode().CreateChildNode(box);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode().CreateChildNode(box);
// save compressed AMF file
scene.Save(dir + "output.amf", new AMFSaveOptions() {
  EnableCompression = true
});
```
